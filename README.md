# PscdoKNC-and-Adaboost-Based-Method-for-iDNA-Recognition
The proposed framework first uses three methods to combine three algorithms to extract features. Further, we apply Adaboost weight ranking to select optimal feature subsets from the above three types of features. Based on the selected features, three algorithms (k-nearest neighbor (knn), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF)) are applied to classify it.
We share the full data and extracted feature data on this place.
The code will be made public after the follow-up work is completed
